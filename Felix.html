          <h1>FELIX</h1>
          <p>Birthday: September 15th 2000</p>
          <p>Position / sub unit: Dance Racha</p>
          <p>Personality Type: ENFP-T</p>
          <p>Representative Animal: Chick</p>
          <p>Birth name: Felix Lee</p>
          <p>Korean name: 이용복 (Lee Yong Bok)</p>
          <p>Felix was born in Sydney, Australia. He randomly decided one day that he wanted to become a dancer, although his parents didn’t approve at first, he ended up making an audition for JYP entertainment, and got accepted. He moved to South Korea when he was 16 years old, without knowing much Korean at all. After BangChan found out that there was another Australian trainee, he immediately added Felix to the potential Stray Kids group. As the reality show premiered, Felix sadly got eliminated on the sixth episode due to his lack of knowing the Korean language, and barely being able to communicate, but just like Lee Know, was added back into the group in the last episode, as he had worked really hard on improving his Korean.</p>
