          <h1>HAN</h1>
          <p>Birthday: September 14th 2000</p>
          <p>Position / sub unit: 3racha</p>
          <p>Personality Type: ISTP-T</p>
          <p>Representative Animal: Quokka</p>
          <p>Birth name: 한지성 (Han Ji Sung)</p>
          <p>Han was born in Incheon, South Korea, but ended up moving to Malaysia after a while. He was always interested in singing, and felt as though he wouldn’t be able to pursue his dream in Malaysia, and made a deal with his parents that if he didn’t get accepted to an entertainment company within a year in Korea, he would come back and continue his studies. He ended up going to a JYP audition with his friend, just in case they would see a celebrity, even though he didn’t think he would get accepted. However he got accepted, and was the first person to meet BangChan and is the youngest member of 3racha, together with Bangchan and Changbin. After making it through the Stray Kids competition, he made his official debut.</p>
