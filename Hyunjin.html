          <h1>HYUNJIN</h1>
          <p>Birthday: March 20th 2000</p>
          <p>Position / sub unit: Dance Racha</p>
          <p>Personality Type: INFP-T</p>
          <p>Representative Animal: Ferret</p>
          <p>Birth name: 황현진 (Hwang Hyun Jin)</p>
          <p>Hyunjin was born in Seoul, South Korea, but lived in Las Vegas for a few months when he was 6 years old. In 2015, he got scouted by a JYP employee when out shopping with his mom. After looking into more information about the company, and made sure it wasn’t a scam, he ended up joining the company. At first, he didn’t really have a lot of talent in dancing, rapping or singing, and even started hating dancing, he got told that he didn’t need talents to debut because he is good looking, which only pushed him to training harder, and eventually got really good at all the qualities he previously felt insecure about, especially dancing. He was added into the Stray kids lineup after making it through the competition show, and made his debut in 2018 with the other members.</p>
