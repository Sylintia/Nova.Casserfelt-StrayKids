          <p>I.N was born in Busan, South Korea. His passion for music was clear from a very young age, and he learned the Korean traditional way of singing called Trot, which he used to perform to the elders in his town. After deciding to become a singer, he made a deal with his parents that he had to get accepted into a company before he graduated middle school, otherwise he would give up on that dream and go back to studying full time. After making an audition to JYP entertainment and failing, they called back at a later date and asked him to come do another audition, which he passed this time. He debuted as the youngest member (the maknae) of Stray Kids after 2 years of training, and after making it through the competition show. </p>
