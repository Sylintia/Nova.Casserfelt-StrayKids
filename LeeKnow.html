          <p>Lee Know was born in Gimpo, South Korea. Growing up, he was very interested in dancing, and very talented at that. He worked as a professional dancer before becoming a kpop idol, and was a backup dancer for BTS on their Japanese tour. He was called to a JYP entertainment audition, but didn’t hear anything from them after, so naturally he thought he had failed. However, the company called back after a few years and asked him to become a trainee, which he did. After a year in the company, the Stray Kids survival show began, which he was sadly eliminated from in the third episode, but was added back into the group in the last episode.
