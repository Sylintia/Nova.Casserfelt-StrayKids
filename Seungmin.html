          <p>Seungmin was born in Seoul, South Korea. When he was in fourth grade, he lived in Los Angeles for 3 months, but moved back to South Korea. Growing up, he really enjoyed playing baseball, but was forced to quit. He had always liked singing, and had always dreamt of joining JYP entertainment, so after placing 2nd place in a JYP open audition, he got accepted into the company. He worked really hard trying to make it to debut, and ended up making his dream come true after making it through the Stray Kids show, and becoming a vocalist in the group. </p>
