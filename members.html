      <p>BangChan was born in Seoul, South Korea, but moved to Sydney, Australia when he was very young. One day when his mother picked him up from school, she asked him if he would like to do an audition for JYP entertainment, since he was really interested in music from a very young age. He passed the audition and moved back to South Korea in 2010. In 2016, he and two other members, Changbin and Han, created a rap group they called 3racha, which later on became the producing sub unit of Stray kids. He was asked by the company to pick out a few trainees from the company he would like to debut with, and ended up picking the other stray kids members, and naturally became the leader of the group. In 2017, Stray kids was presented to the world through their reality competition show “Stray Kids”, and made their official debut on the 25th of March 2018, and BangChan finally made his debut after 7 years of being a trainee. </p>
