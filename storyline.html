  <p>All the information regarding the Stray Kids storyline is entirely speculation among fans, none of the stated information is fact, and is open for further discussion. All the stated information is a collection of theories made by fans throughout the years, and there is no right answer to what the storyline is about.</p>

      <p>The Stray Kids storyline starts off with the trailer for the I am Not minialbum, where the members can be seen doing different tasks that they appear to have been doing for a while. Suddenly all members start thinking about why they are doing those tasks, and what the point in everything is. When they start thinking is when they create a glitch within this community they live in. The only member this doesnät occur to is I.N, as he is on the bus, on his way to meet up with the rest of the members, when he sees a clone of himself outside the window. He then gets off the bus and the clone gets on the bus, meaning the clone meets up with stray kids instead of the real I.N. </p>

      <p>The district 9 music video starts off with all the members having met up after they discovered the glitch in the system. In order to communicate without getting any attention from the system, they pass along a note, which at one point reached I.N, without them knowing that the I.N they have met up with is a clone. They then go to a bus which they will use to break out of the system, and when they have done that is the first moment in the video you can see normal colours, symbolising that they are free from being controlled. They decide to raise a flag and dance among flames in order to celebrate their freedom.</p>

      <p>When the Stray kids storyline passes through the My Pace music video, it can be seen that all the members are having fun for the first time in their lives, they are happy to finally be free. They are dancing among cars, and are around other people, which is something that is clear they have not been able to do when they were controlled by the system. However, what they don’t know is that they are still being monitored, and the system is always one step before them, as they have a clone among them, and they are still close enough to the system for them to be picked up again. </p>

      <p>When entering the I am You music video, they have started to notice that they are being watched, as they are taking down cameras, and starting their adventures to get far away. They are trying to make use of what they have, and are trying to create a new home with the little things they have. However, they are always on the run, and are traveling with a truck, trying to escape even further. In this music video it is very clear that I.N is reporting back everything to the system, as we are able to see a reflection of BangChan talking in I.Ns face. By the end of the music video, they are all standing, looking out over the city of Miroh, which is their next stop on their adventure.</p>

      <p>When they enter the city of Miroh, there is a demonstration going on, with the people who have power being in control of it, also known as the people who were controlling them, the people behind the system. When they are in the city, they are starting to plan a big riot, with I.N reporting back on everything. But even though he does that, the riot is still taking place, and Stray Kids end up winning against the people in control. They are giving speeches, delivering their points of views, and trying to make more people join their idea of how people should be allowed to make their own decisions, and to have their own views.</p>

      <p>With the trailer of Clé 2: Yellow Wood, Stray Kids are discovering an elevator, and when they enter the elevator, they are taken up, to the city of Miroh, where they see that the people with power they were fighting against before, have regained their power, and they start to realise that all their hard work was for nothing. However, BangChan finds a key, which he uses to click on a button with the letters “YW” on it. When he does that, the elevator suddenly drops to the bottom floor, and they have reached Yellow Wood.</p>

      <p>In the beginning of Side Effects, a bus is driving by, dropping off all the stuff they left in Miroh. As they stand in front of the elevator that is now out of use, two moons appear, and they are going to play a big part in the continuation of the storyline. They are continuing their travels as their mission in Miroh ended up being a fail. Frustrated and annoyed they start blaming themselves and each other, which results in a fight taking place, but at the end of the day, they only have each other, and they still have to continue traveling in order to survive.</p>

      <p>By the time we get to Double Knot, Stray kids are still not back to normal from what happened in Miroh, in fact, things are only getting weirder. They are starting to act out of place, and they seem lost. There are still drones following them, and they understand that they are still under surveillance. They are also starting to notice something strange about I.N, they are starting to figure out that they don’t have the real I.N. By this time they have also found multiple keys, but they are trying to find the key that will work on the elevator that took them to Yellow Wood, but the keys they found seem to lead to doors.</p>

      <p>In Astronaut Hyunjin finds an orb, which is talking to him, which allows them to feel the same kind of happiness as they felt in I am You again. They learn to accept the situation through being brainwashed to go back to the system they escaped from. At one point in the video, Hyunjin finds all the members inside a cage, while they were being brainwashed, but he stops at I.N, because he notices that he is the only one who isn’t blanked out, because he is a clone. In the end of the video we get to see the real I.N again, and we learn that he has been chasing after them this whole time.</p>

      <p>The group of Stray Kids in Hellevator is not the same group as in previous music videos, this group is from a parallel universe. This group has not yet escaped the system, but they have noticed something strange about it. They are playing around and setting things on fire at an old school, when Han finds the so called “Hellevator”. This elevator goes up, and when they exit it they find themselves on a field full of purple flowers, with the city of Miroh hanging from the sky, and as the hellevator goes up, symbolised that Miroh is hell. This purple field leads us to Levanter.</p>

      <p>In Levanter the two versions of stray kids meet each other, causing the worlds to kind of fall apart. The ground is ripping open, and things are flying everywhere, which is happening because the parallel universes are colliding, which is further realized as the two moons that have been present in every video from Side Effects are emerging together. As this is happening, Stray Kids are starting to accept I.N as one of them, because he has been there from when they escaped, and he is basically one of them even though he isn’t the real one.</p>
